Change ringing is a very specific way of making music with an arbitrary
(natural) number of uniquely pitched bells (labeled with the numbers 1,2,...,n
in descending order of pitch). The bells are rung only one at the time in rapid
succession with regular time intervals. No bell is allowed to ring again before
all bells have been rung. Thus this kind of music consists of sequences of what
is called <em>changes</em>, <em>rows</em> or <em>permutations</em>, that is,
the act of ringing through all the n bells once in some order. All permutations
are allowed, but not all sequences of permutations are allowed. For starters,
you cannot repeat a previously rung permutation within a sequence, which gives
these sequences a maximum length of factorial(n). Still, most of the sequences
satisfying this criterion are not allowed due to several more criteria. Let us
take a look at a complete definition to see exactly what types of sequences of
permutations that are allowed in change ringing.

</p>

<p>
Let n be a positive integer. A <b><em>change ringing sequence for n
bells</em></b> is a sequence of permutations of the set {1,2,...,n} that
satisfies the following criteria.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The position of each bell (number) from one permutation to the next can stay the
        same or move by at most one place.
    </li>
    <li>
        No permutation can be repeated except for the starting permutation
        which can be repeated at most once at the end of the sequence to
        accommodate criterion 4.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must start with the permutation (1,2,...,n)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Optional criteria that differentiates types of sequences.
</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>
        The sequence must end with the same permutation that it started with.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must contain all permutations.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
There exists a few more optional criteria (
<a href="https://math.ch/TMU2017/Campanology_Ringing_the_changes.pdf">Look Here</a>
), but they are not relevant for this project. Also, sometimes criterion 3 is
viewed as optional instead of mandatory.
</p>

<hr noshade="">

<p>
We define an
<b><em>extent</em></b>
as a sequence that satisfies all five criteria.
</p>

<p>
We define a
<b><em>peal</em></b>
as a sequence that satisfies criterion 1,2,3,4 and <b>not</b> 5.
</p>

<p>
We define the <b><em>length</em></b> of a change ringing sequence as the number
of unique permutations in the sequence.
</p>

<p>
We define a <b><em>cyclic sequence</em></b> as a sequence that satisfies
criterion 1,2,3,4. These sequences start and end with (1,2,...,n).
</p>

<p>
We define a <b><em>path sequence</em></b> as a sequence that satisfies criterion
1,2,3 and <b>not</b> 4. None of the path sequences are cyclic, but every cyclic
sequence becomes a path sequence if you remove it's ending permutation.
</p>

<p>
We define a <b><em>noncappable sequence</em></b> as a path sequence that has an
ending permutation that cannot immeadiately transition to the starting permutation.
Thus we cannot append the starting permutation (cap it and make it cyclic)
without breaking criterion 1.
</p>

<p>
We define a <b><em>nonclosable sequence</em></b> as a path sequence that cannot
be made cyclic by appending any number of permutations.
</p>

<p>
We define a <b><em>nonfillable sequence</em></b> as a path sequence that cannot
be made to satisfy criterion 5 by appending any number of permutations while
still satisfying criterion 1,2,3.
</p>


<hr noshade="">

<p>
Criterion 1 heavily limits the number of <b><em>allowable transitions</em></b> (also
called <b><em>allowable transition rules</em></b>) from one permutation to another .
</p>

<p>
For n=2 there is only 1 allowable transition.
</p>
<code><pre>
ab
><
ba
</pre></code>

<p>
For n=3 there are 2 allowable transitions.
</p>
<code><pre>
abc
><
bac
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
abc
 ><
acb
</pre></code>

<p>
For n=4 there are 4.
</p>

<code><pre>
abcd
><
bacd
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
abcd
 ><
acbd
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
abcd
  ><
abdc
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
abcd
><><
badc
</pre></code>


<p>
There are 24 permutations of four bells, thus most permutations are out of
reach in a single transition. This continues to be the case for larger numbers
of bells, as the ratio of number of allowable transition rules to the number of
permutations tends to zero as n tends to infinity.
