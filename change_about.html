<h3>About change ringing patterns</h3>
<p>
A change ringing pattern with n bells is a sequence of permutations of the set
{1,2,...,n-1,n} that satisfies the following criteria.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Sequence starts with the permutation
        <pre><code> 1,2,...,(n-1),n </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        No permutation can be repeated.^[*]
    </li>
    <li>
        The position of each bell from one permutation to the next can stay the
        same or move by at most one place.
    </li>
</ol>



<p>
Additional criteria that makes the patterns nicer are
</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>
        Sequence ends with a permutation which can be immediately changed into the starting permutation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Must visit all permutations, i.e. pattern has length factorial(n).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
All change ringing patterns on this page satisfies criteria 4. In addition to listing
patterns that also satisfy criteria 5, which we call <b><em>full patterns</em></b>,
we also list patterns that does not satisfy criteria 5. We call these
<b><em>short patterns</em></b> and try to categorize them by their
length which will always be less than factorial(n). This gives n-1 categories
of short patterns. We will not bother listing the trivial pattern of length 1,
and we will omit counting the ending permutation when we have appended the
starting pattern for aesthetic completion when criteria 4 is satisfied.
