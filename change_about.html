<h2>About change ringing patterns</h2>
<p>
A <b><em>change ringing pattern with n bells</em></b> is a sequence of permutations of the set
{1,2,...,n-1,n} that satisfies the following criteria.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The sequence must start with the permutation
        <pre><code> 1,2,...,(n-1),n </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must end with the same permutation that it started with.
    </li>
    <li>
        No permutation can be repeated except for the starting permutation
        which must be repeated once in accordance with criterion 2.
    </li>
    <li>
        The position of each bell from one permutation to the next can stay the
        same or move by at most one place.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
An optional criterion is
</p>
<ol start="5">
    <li>
        The sequence must contain all permutations, i.e. pattern has length factorial(n).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
We define the <b><em>length</em></b> of a change ringing pattern as the number
of unique permutations in the pattern.
</p>

<p>
A change ringing pattern that satisfy criterion 5 is called a
<b><em>full pattern</em></b>.
</p>

<p>
A change ringing pattern that does not satisfy criterion 5 is called a
<b><em>short pattern</em></b>.
</p>

<p>
We will list both full and short patterns. We will categorize short patterns by
their length. Short patterns have length < factorial(n). This gives n-1
categories of short patterns. We will not bother listing patterns of length
0 (empty) and length 1 (only the starting permutation).
