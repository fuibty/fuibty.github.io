<h2>About change ringing patterns</h2>
<p>
Let n be a positive integer. A <b><em>change ringing pattern for n
bells</em></b> can be represented by a sequence of permutations of
the set {1,2,...,n-1,n} that satisfies the following criteria.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The sequence must start with the permutation
        <pre><code> (1,2,...,n-1,n) </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must end with the starting permutation.
    </li>
    <li>
        No permutation can be repeated except for the starting permutation
        which can be repeated at most once at the end of the pattern to
        accommodate criterion 2.
    </li>
    <li>
        The position of each bell from one permutation to the next can stay the
        same or move by at most one place.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
An optional and very common criterion is
</p>

<ol start="5">
    <li>
        The sequence must contain all permutations.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
We define a
<b><em>full pattern</em></b>
as a pattern that satisfies all criteria.
</p>


<p>
We define a
<b><em>short pattern</em></b>
as a pattern that satisfies all criteria except criterion 5.
</p>


<p>
We define the <b><em>length</em></b> of a change ringing pattern as the number
of unique permutations in the pattern.
</p>


<p>
A full pattern contains all permutations. There are factorial(n) permutations
of n bells, so the length of a full pattern is always factorial(n).
</p>

<p>
A short pattern does not contain all permutations, hence it has a length less
than factorial(n).
</p>

<p>
We will list both full and short patterns on this page. We will categorize
patterns by their length. There is only one pattern of length 1 for any n,
namely the pattern consisting solely the starting permutation. There are no
patterns of length 0 since all patterns must at least have the starting
permutation (criterion 1).
</p>

<p>
What about patterns for 0 bells? Remember that n is a positive integer, hence
per definition there are no change ringing pattern for 0 bells. What is the
reason for this?  Imagine a pattern for 0 bells. Since there are no
bells to permute, there are no patterns of any length.
