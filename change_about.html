<h2>About change ringing patterns</h2>
<p>
Let n be a positive integer. A <b><em>change ringing pattern for n
bells</em></b> can be represented by a sequence of permutations of
the set {1,2,...,n-1,n} that satisfies the following criteria.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The position of each bell from one permutation to the next can stay the
        same or move by at most one place.
    </li>
    <li>
        No permutation can be repeated except for the starting permutation
        which can be repeated at most once at the end of the pattern to
        accommodate criterion 4.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Optional criteria
</p>

<ol start="3">
    <li>
        The sequence must start with the permutation (1,2,...,n-1,n)
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must end with the same permutation that it started with.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sequence must contain all permutations.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
We define a
<b><em>full pattern</em></b>
as a pattern that satisfies all five criteria.
</p>


<p>
We define a
<b><em>short pattern</em></b>
as a pattern that satisfies criteria 1-4, but does not satisfy criterion 5.
</p>


<p>
We define the <b><em>length</em></b> of a change ringing pattern as the number
of unique permutations in the pattern.
</p>


<p>
A full pattern contains all permutations. There are factorial(n) permutations
of n bells, so the length of a full pattern is always factorial(n).
</p>

<p>
A short pattern does not contain all permutations, hence it has a length less
than factorial(n).
</p>

<p>
There is only one pattern of length 1, namely the pattern consisting solely the
starting permutation. There are no patterns of length 0 since all patterns must
at least have the starting permutation (criterion 1).
</p>

<p>
We define a <em><b>cyclic pattern</b></em> as a pattern that satisfies criteria
1-4. "Cyclic" because such patterns start and end with the same permutation.
</p>

<p>
We define a <em><b>path pattern</b></em> as a pattern that satisfies criteria
1-3. "Path" because such patterns are not necessarily cyclic, although every
cyclic pattern is also a path pattern.
</p>

<p>
We define a <em><b>non-cyclic pattern</b></em> as a pattern that satisfies
criteria 1-3, but does not satisfy criterion 4. I.e. a non-cyclic pattern is
a path pattern that is not cyclic.
